During the episode, were there limb jerking, foaming at the mouth, or urinary/fecal incontinence? Was the loss of consciousness a complete coma or a brief blackout? Was there vomiting or a sudden severe headache? Did you have unilateral limb weakness, slurred speech, or facial drooping? Were there symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia, such as sweating, palpitations, or tremors? Recently, have you had fever, productive cough, or signs of infection? In addition, do you have a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, arrhythmia, or stroke?",

During the episode, there were no limb convulsions, foaming at the mouth, or urinary or fecal incontinence. The loss of consciousness occurred suddenly, manifested as upward rolling of the eyes. After being awakened by family members, the patient was able to move. This should be considered a brief disturbance of consciousness rather than a complete coma. There was no mention of vomiting or sudden severe headache. There were no signs of unilateral limb weakness, slurred speech, or facial drooping. There was sweating, but no mention of palpitations or hand tremors. Recently, there was no mention of fever, productive cough, or obvious signs of infection. The patient has a history of hypertension and bronchial asthma, no history of diabetes or stroke. As for coronary artery disease or arrhythmia, it was not mentioned and is therefore unclear.",

  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Cardiogenic syncope, with possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n   Reasoning: Prior to the episode, there was no headache, dizziness, or convulsions, but there was chest tightness and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension and bronchial asthma. The loss of consciousness occurred suddenly, manifested as upward rolling of the eyes, and the patient could move after being awakened by family members, suggesting a brief disturbance of consciousness rather than complete coma. There was no vomiting or sudden severe headache, and no unilateral limb weakness, slurred speech, or facial drooping. There was sweating, without palpitations or tremors. The ECG showed bradycardia with ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in some leads.",
  "Treatment": "1. Urgently complete relevant examinations, provide monitoring, maintain vital signs, ensure airway patency, continuous ECG monitoring, administer oxygen if necessary, and prepare for resuscitation in case of cardiac arrest.\n\n2. Identify the underlying cause based on examination results and provide appropriate targeted treatment. For example, if myocardial infarction (MI) is confirmed, initiate dual antiplatelet therapy with loading doses and proceed with emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)."
