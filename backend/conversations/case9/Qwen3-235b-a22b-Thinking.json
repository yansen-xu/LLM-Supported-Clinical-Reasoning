  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute inferior and posterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n   Reasoning: ECG showed qR pattern with ST-segment elevation of 0.3–0.5 mV and T-wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF, and ST-segment elevation of 0.2 mV with T-wave inversion in leads V7–V9, which are characteristic ECG changes of acute myocardial infarction. The patient had sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by ischemic symptoms such as chest tightness, sweating, and fatigue.\n\n2. Conclusion: Second-degree type I atrioventricular block (2:1 conduction)\n   Reasoning: ECG demonstrated a 2:1 atrioventricular conduction ratio, consistent with the electrophysiological characteristics of second-degree type I AV block.\n\n3. Conclusion: Cardiogenic syncope\n   Reasoning: Sudden loss of consciousness occurred in the setting of atrioventricular block leading to a significant decrease in ventricular rate, with an underlying pathophysiological basis of myocardial ischemia.",
  "Treatment": "1. Pharmacological treatment:\n   Aspirin 300 mg chewed (loading dose) → 100 mg/day maintenance\n   Clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose → 75 mg/day maintenance\n   Enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous injection (with activated partial thromboplastin time monitoring)\n   Metoprolol sustained-release tablets 23.75 mg/day (initiated in the absence of contraindications)\n   Atorvastatin calcium 80 mg nightly\n   Enalapril (to be initiated after blood pressure stabilization)\n\n2. Non-pharmacological treatment:\n   Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (primary choice)\n   Temporary pacemaker implantation (if ventricular rate <40 beats/min or hemodynamic instability occurs)\n   Continuous ECG monitoring and hemodynamic monitoring"
