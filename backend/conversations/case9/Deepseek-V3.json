My family said my eyes rolled upward, I was sweating a lot, and my face looked extremely pale. After a few minutes, I woke up on my own. They said there were no convulsions, no jaw clenching, and no shaking of my arms or legs, and there was no loss of bowel or bladder control. After waking up, I could speak normally, and my arms and legs could move. I didn’t feel particularly uncomfortable.",

  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute inferior–posterior wall myocardial infarction with an Adams–Stokes attack\n   Reasoning: 1) Typical angina symptoms (throat tightness for 2 years); 2) Sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by pallor and sweating; 3) ECG showing ST–T changes in inferior and posterior leads\n\n2. Conclusion: Cardiogenic syncope\n   Reasoning: 1) Typical Adams–Stokes syndrome presentation: sudden loss of consciousness with pallor and sweating;\n2) Syncope of clear cardiac origin (ECG showing inferior–posterior myocardial ischemic changes);\n3) No convulsions and no urinary or fecal incontinence, consistent with cardiogenic syncope;\n4) Spontaneous recovery of consciousness with no focal neurological signs\n\n3. Conclusion: Sudden cardiac death\n   Reasoning: 1) Meets the definition of sudden cardiac death: sudden loss of consciousness with circulatory arrest;\n2) ECG suggests the possibility of malignant arrhythmia;\n3) Presence of an underlying cause of myocardial infarction;\n4) Spontaneous recovery indicates a state of successful resuscitation from sudden cardiac death",
  "Treatment": "1. 1) Aspirin 300 mg chewed;\n2) Clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose;\n3) Low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation;\n4) Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nContinuous ECG monitoring for 24 hours is required, with absolute bed rest and oxygen therapy."
