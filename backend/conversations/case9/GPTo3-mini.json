  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute inferior and posterior myocardial infarction\n   Reasoning: The 12-lead ECG shows qR patterns with ST-segment elevation (0.3–0.5 mV) and T-wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF. ST-segment elevation (0.2 mV) and T-wave inversion are also present in leads V7–V9. These findings are consistent with inferior and posterior myocardial infarction. The presence of second-degree type I atrioventricular block (2:1 conduction) is commonly associated with inferior myocardial infarction due to involvement of the atrioventricular nodal blood supply. The patient’s sudden loss of consciousness suggests possible myocardial ischemia or electrophysiological instability leading to hemodynamic compromise.\n\n2. Conclusion: Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (manifesting as stable angina)\n   Reasoning: The patient has experienced throat tightening during exertion for the past two years, which may represent an atypical manifestation of ischemic angina. The history of hypertension and irregular medication adherence suggests long-term myocardial ischemia.\n\n3. Conclusion: Cardiac conduction system abnormality – atrioventricular block\n   Reasoning: The ECG demonstrates second-degree type I atrioventricular block (2:1 conduction), which is consistent with involvement of the atrioventricular node in the setting of acute inferior myocardial infarction.",
  "Treatment": "1. Arrange coronary angiography as soon as possible to assess the location and severity of coronary lesions, with priority consideration for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nIf PCI indications are clear, proceed promptly to the catheterization laboratory.\nIf timely intervention is not available and the patient is within the therapeutic window, assess eligibility for thrombolytic therapy while carefully evaluating contraindications.\n\n2. Antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin—initial loading dose of 300 mg (chewed), followed by a maintenance dose of 81–100 mg daily; P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel)—loading dose of 300–600 mg, followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg daily.\nAnticoagulation therapy: Intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, with dosing adjusted according to body weight, in conjunction with PCI.\nStatin therapy: High-intensity statin such as atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and improve endothelial function.\nBlood pressure management and myocardial protection: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs, such as enalapril or benazepril), with gradual dose titration. Given the patient’s history of bronchial asthma, beta-blockers should be used with caution; if necessary, a cardioselective agent (e.g., low-dose metoprolol) may be considered with close monitoring of respiratory status.\nRelief of ischemic symptoms: Nitroglycerin administered sublingually or intravenously as needed.\nIf atrioventricular block worsens or is accompanied by hemodynamic instability, prepare for temporary pacing.\n\n3. Intensive care unit monitoring: Continuous ECG monitoring to observe conduction abnormalities and potential arrhythmias.\nHemodynamic support: Adjust fluid management based on monitoring data and administer inotropic agents if necessary.\nRehabilitation and follow-up: Establish a cardiac rehabilitation program, with regular follow-up to assess cardiac function, lipid profile, and blood pressure, and to adjust secondary prevention strategies.\nLifestyle interventions: Smoking cessation, dietary control, and appropriate physical activity.\n\n4. After stabilization in the acute phase, arrange outpatient follow-up to assess cardiac function.\nRegular repeat ECG and echocardiography.\nAdjust long-term antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive therapy based on coronary angiography findings."
