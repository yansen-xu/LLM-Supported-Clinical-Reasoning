  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute inferior–posterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n   Reasoning: Chest tightness and back pain for 5 days, triggered by brisk walking;\nEmergency ECG: ST-segment elevation of 0.2–0.5 mV with T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V7–V9, consistent with inferior and posterior STEMI;\nElevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at 0.32 ng/mL;\nAssociated syncope (loss of consciousness 1 hour prior), suggesting an acute cardiogenic event.\n\n2. Conclusion: Second-degree type I atrioventricular block (2:1)\n   Reasoning: ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm with 2:1 Wenckebach atrioventricular conduction.\n\n3. Conclusion: (To be ruled out) Right ventricular myocardial infarction\n   Reasoning: Inferior STEMI combined with atrioventricular block; right-sided chest leads V4R–V6R are required for confirmation.\n\n4. Conclusion: Chronic intermittent throat tightening sensation (to be further evaluated; possible gastroesophageal reflux or laryngopharyngeal reflux)\n   Reasoning: Symptoms present for 2 years and currently not directly related to the acute event.",
  "Treatment": "1. Immediate reperfusion therapy\nPreferred option: Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with a target door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes; if coronary reperfusion cannot be achieved within 120 minutes, evaluate for thrombolysis (alteplase/tenecteplase) within 10 minutes and transfer for rescue PCI.\n\n2. Medications prior to PCI:\nAspirin: loading dose 300 mg chewed, followed by maintenance dose 100 mg once daily (qd), lifelong therapy.\nTicagrelor (preferred) or clopidogrel:\nTicagrelor: 180 mg loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily (bid) for 12 months.\nOr clopidogrel: 600 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg once daily (qd).\nCombined with aspirin as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).\nUnfractionated heparin: intravenous bolus 60 U/kg (maximum 4000 U), followed by continuous infusion at 12 U/kg·h; dose adjusted during PCI according to activated clotting time (ACT).\nNitroglycerin: 0.4 mg sublingually, repeatable up to 3 doses; indicated only if systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg and right ventricular infarction has been excluded.\nMorphine: intravenous 2–4 mg for severe pain, with monitoring of blood pressure and respiratory status.\nOxygen therapy: administer when oxygen saturation (SpO₂) < 90% or if dyspnea is present, targeting SpO₂ 94–98%.\nBeta-blockers contraindicated: temporarily withhold due to presence of 2:1 atrioventricular block.\n\n3. Management of concomitant conduction disturbance\nAtropine 0.5 mg IV under monitoring, repeatable up to a total dose of 3 mg;\nIf hypotension or persistent 2:1 atrioventricular block occurs, consider temporary transvenous pacing (commonly associated with proximal right coronary artery occlusion).\n\n4. Post-PCI / in-hospital management\nHigh-intensity statin therapy: atorvastatin 40–80 mg once daily, initiated on the first night;\nWithin 24 hours, evaluate for addition of ACEI/ARB; if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% and serum potassium < 5.0 mmol/L, add spironolactone;\nBeta-blockers may be initiated after resolution of atrioventricular block and heart rate ≥ 60 bpm (e.g., metoprolol 25 mg four times daily as starting dose);\nRepeat echocardiography, complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver and renal function tests;\nMonitor cardiac troponin levels and ECG, with vigilance for heart failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n5. Thrombolytic pathway (only if timely PCI is not available)\nTenecteplase 16 mg IV bolus, single dose;\nRepeat ECG at 30–60 minutes: ≥ 50% ST-segment resolution indicates successful thrombolysis; otherwise, proceed immediately to rescue PCI.\n\n6. Secondary prevention after discharge\nDual antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 100 mg once daily (qd) combined with ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily (bid) for a total duration of 12 months. If bleeding risk is low, transition to aspirin monotherapy after 12 months.\nLipid management: target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 1.4 mmol/L. High-intensity statins are first-line; add PCSK9 inhibitors if necessary.\nBlood pressure control: target ≤ 130/80 mmHg. Combination therapy with ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers is recommended.\nLifestyle interventions: smoking cessation, low-salt and low-saturated-fat diet, participation in cardiac rehabilitation, and at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily; maintain body weight with BMI < 25.\nFollow-up plan: outpatient visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge, including symptom assessment, ECG, lipid profile, liver and renal function tests, and evaluation of DAPT adherence.\nAdditional measures: influenza and pneumococcal vaccination are recommended; if throat tightening persists after discharge, elective gastroscopy or otolaryngology (ENT) evaluation may be considered after stabilization."
