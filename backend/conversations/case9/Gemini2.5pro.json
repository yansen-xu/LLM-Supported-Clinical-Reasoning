  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\nInfarct location: Acute inferior wall combined with posterior wall myocardial infarction\nCulprit vessel (inferred): Acute occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA)\n   Reasoning: Prodromal symptoms: The patient’s 2-year history of “throat tightness” and 5 days of “back pain” represent typical angina-equivalent warning symptoms. In elderly men, such atypical radiation pain is very common and actually reflects myocardial ischemia.\nMalignant event: The episode of “loss of consciousness” 1 hour prior was caused by a large myocardial infarction leading to a sharp decline in cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion, resulting in syncope—one of the most dangerous clinical presentations.\nDecisive ECG evidence: The ECG is the cornerstone of this diagnosis and provides irrefutable evidence.\nInferior wall infarction: Leads II, III, and aVF showed qR patterns with significant ST-segment elevation, which is the classic ECG pattern of acute transmural inferior wall myocardial infarction.\nPosterior wall infarction: Leads V7–V9 also demonstrated ST-segment elevation, confirming extension of the infarction to the posterior wall of the left ventricle.\nOverall assessment: This represents an extensive and extremely high-risk acute inferior-posterior STEMI.\nLaboratory support: Elevated white blood cell count (12.5×10⁹/L) reflects a stress-related inflammatory response following myocardial necrosis and serves as supportive evidence.\n\n2. Conclusion: Cardiogenic shock\n   Reasoning: On arrival, the blood pressure was only 80/40 mmHg, indicating severe pump failure of the heart, unable to maintain adequate systemic perfusion.\n\n3. Conclusion: High-grade atrioventricular block\n   Reasoning: The ECG demonstrated second-degree type I atrioventricular block with bradycardia (heart rate 54 bpm). This is due to occlusion of the right coronary artery, which supplies the atrioventricular node, resulting in severe conduction system impairment.\n\n4. Conclusion: Right ventricular myocardial infarction\n   Reasoning: In the setting of acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, the coexistence of cardiogenic shock and high-grade atrioventricular block strongly suggests involvement of the right ventricle.",
  "Treatment": "1. I. Ideal emergency management (standard protocol)\n1. Immediate reperfusion therapy: This is the only core intervention to save life and myocardium.\nFirst choice: Emergency coronary angiography with stent implantation (percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI) to directly reopen the occluded right coronary artery.\nAlternative: If timely PCI is not available, immediate intravenous thrombolytic therapy should be administered.\n2. Emergency life support:\nManagement of shock: The use of dopamine was appropriate, but norepinephrine should be the first-line agent. In right ventricular infarction, cautious volume resuscitation should be attempted first. If ineffective, mechanical circulatory support such as intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) should be considered.\nManagement of bradycardia: Immediate implantation of a temporary pacemaker to ensure an adequate heart rate and maintain life.\n3. Basic pharmacologic therapy:\nImmediate administration of aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor or clopidogrel) as dual antiplatelet therapy.\nImmediate intravenous anticoagulation with heparin.\nNitrates are strictly contraindicated, as they may worsen hypotension in right ventricular infarction.\n\n2. II. Long-term management and treatment recommendations after discharge (for this patient)\nComprehensive cardiac evaluation:\nEchocardiography: Must be performed to assess overall cardiac structure, left and right ventricular size and function (ejection fraction, LVEF), and to evaluate for complications such as ventricular aneurysm. This forms the basis for subsequent therapeutic decisions.\nCoronary angiography: Although the optimal emergency window was missed, elective angiography is still recommended to define the overall extent of coronary artery disease, assess for severe stenoses in other vessels, and determine the need for further intervention.\nOptimization of guideline-directed medical therapy (“life-saving medications”): The current regimen (amlodipine plus aspirin) is far from sufficient. Under physician guidance, treatment should be promptly adjusted to standard post–myocardial infarction secondary prevention:\nDual antiplatelet therapy: Add a P2Y12 inhibitor (such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor) on top of aspirin and continue for at least one year.\nStatin therapy: High-intensity statins (e.g., atorvastatin) should be used regardless of baseline lipid levels to stabilize plaques and prevent recurrence.\nACE inhibitors or ARBs: Such as perindopril or valsartan, to inhibit ventricular remodeling, slow progression to heart failure, and assist in blood pressure control.\nβ-blockers: Such as metoprolol or bisoprolol. If heart rate and blood pressure allow, these should be used to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.\nAldosterone receptor antagonists: Such as spironolactone. If echocardiography shows significantly reduced cardiac function (LVEF ≤40%), this medication should be added."
