  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI)\n   Reasoning: ECG showed ST-segment elevation (0.3–0.5 mV) with qR pattern and T-wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF, suggesting inferior wall myocardial ischemia/infarction.\n   ST-segment elevation (0.2 mV) with T-wave inversion in leads V7–V9 suggests posterior wall myocardial ischemia.\n   The patient has a history of hypertension and activity-induced chest tightness with radiating back pain, consistent with risk factors and symptoms of myocardial ischemia.\n\n2. Conclusion: Second-degree type I atrioventricular block\n   Reasoning: ECG clearly demonstrated second-degree type I AV block (2:1 conduction).\n   Inferior wall myocardial infarction often involves the atrioventricular node region, leading to conduction system injury.\n\n3. Conclusion: Hypertension (poorly controlled)\n   Reasoning: The patient reports a history of hypertension without specific information on blood pressure control; hypertension is associated with myocardial infarction.\n\n4. Conclusion: Syncope (cardiogenic)\n   Reasoning: Loss of consciousness accompanied by diaphoresis and pallor, without convulsions, is consistent with cardiogenic syncope.\n   Second-degree AV block may cause a sudden drop in cardiac output, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion.\n\n5. Conclusion: Potential cardiac dysfunction\n   Reasoning: Myocardial infarction may result in reduced myocardial contractility; further evaluation of left ventricular function is required.\n\n6. Conclusion: Possible coronary artery spasm or microvascular disease\n   Reasoning: Activity-related throat tightness may represent an atypical manifestation of angina.",
  "Treatment": "1. Emergency management:\n   Antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 300 mg chewed immediately; clopidogrel 300 mg intravenous or oral loading dose.\n   Anticoagulation: Low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously, with activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] monitoring).\n   Nitrates: Intravenous nitroglycerin infusion (initial dose 5–10 μg/min, adjusted according to blood pressure) to relieve myocardial ischemia.\n   Beta-blocker: Metoprolol 5–10 mg intravenous injection (if no contraindications) to control heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption.\n   ECG monitoring and temporary pacing: Continuous rhythm monitoring; second-degree AV block may progress to third-degree block, so a temporary pacemaker should be readily available.\n\n2. Coronary reperfusion therapy:\n   Emergency coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): Primary PCI is preferred to open the infarct-related artery (e.g., right coronary artery).\n   If immediate PCI is not feasible, thrombolytic therapy (e.g., alteplase 50–100 mg intravenous thrombolysis) may be considered.\n\n3. Pharmacological therapy:\n   Aspirin 100 mg once daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg once daily (or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily) for long-term antiplatelet therapy.\n   Calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem) or beta-blockers to control heart rate and blood pressure.\n   Statins (e.g., atorvastatin 20–40 mg nightly) for intensive lipid-lowering therapy.\n   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g., perindopril 4 mg once daily) to improve ventricular remodeling (renal function and serum potassium should be monitored).\n\n4. Blood pressure management:\n   Target blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, using long-acting calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) or angiotensin II receptor blockers.\n   Lifestyle interventions: smoking cessation, low-salt and low-fat diet, and moderate exercise (to be planned after cardiac function assessment).\n\n5. In-hospital management:\n   Daily monitoring of troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and ECG changes; assessment of cardiac function with echocardiography.\n   Evaluation for progression of atrioventricular block, with permanent pacemaker implantation if necessary.\n   Post-discharge: repeat echocardiography, lipid profile, and blood glucose at 1 month; follow-up ECG, cardiac function, and medication adherence every 3–6 months."
