ECG shows qR patterns with ST-segment elevation of 0.3–0.5 mV and T-wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF, and ST-segment elevation of 0.2 mV with T-wave inversion in leads V7–V9. No significant abnormalities were found on neurological examination.\n\n2. Conclusion: Second-degree type I atrioventricular block\n   Reasoning: ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm with second-degree type I atrioventricular block (2:1 conduction).\n\n3. Conclusion: Acute kidney injury (AKI)\n   Reasoning: Blood urea nitrogen 8.0 mmol/L and creatinine 143.7 μmol/L.\n\n4. Conclusion: Hypertension\n   Reasoning: Based on past medical history.\n\n5.

  "Treatment": "1. Ticagrelor 180 mg PO stat, aspirin 100 mg PO stat, clopidogrel 300 mg PO stat, followed by PCI.\n\n2. Central venous catheterization, rapid fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer’s solution 500 mL IV drip stat and normal saline 500 mL IV drip stat. Dopamine infusion at 10 μg/(min·kg) and norepinephrine infusion at 0.1 μg/kg/min.\n\n3. Post-procedure admission to the CCU with continuous ECG monitoring and oxygen therapy. Repeat ECG and complete evaluation including myocardial infarction markers, cardiac enzymes, BNP, proBNP, DIC profile, liver and renal function, electrolytes, arterial blood gas, CRP, ESR, PCT, and lipid profile. Perform echocardiography, chest CT, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and pulmonary function testing.\n\n4. Defibrillation if necessary; if atrioventricular block worsens or progresses, temporary pacing may be required.\n\n5. Indwelling urinary catheter with strict urine output monitoring."
