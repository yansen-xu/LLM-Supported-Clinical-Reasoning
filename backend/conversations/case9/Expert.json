Walking a bit faster can bring it on, and sometimes I break out in a sweat and feel pain in my back. I didn’t pay much attention to it and didn’t see a doctor.",

  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n    Cardiogenic shock\n   Reasoning: Post-exertional chest pain and syncope; ST–T changes in inferior and posterior leads on ECG; risk factors including advanced age, male sex, and hypertension.\n\n2. Conclusion: Hypertension\n   Reasoning: Past medical history",
  "Treatment": "1. Loading-dose dual antiplatelet therapy\n\n2. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI)\n\n3. Post-procedure cardiac monitoring, repeat ECGs, and completion of echocardiography to assess cardiac structure, function, and mechanical complications.\n\n4. Secondary prevention medications: dual antiplatelet therapy (>1 year), statins, and antihypertensive agents (if no contraindications, consider angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor [ARNI] or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] as part of the antihypertensive regimen). Monitor blood pressure and lipid levels, conduct regular outpatient follow-up, and repeat blood tests, biochemistry panels, and ECGs as needed."
