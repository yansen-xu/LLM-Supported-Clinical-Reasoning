  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: common bile duct stones complicated by obstructive jaundice, severe pancreatitis\n   Reasoning: fever, abdominal pain and distension, with elevated amylase (AMY) and jaundice; presence of gallstones and dilation of the common bile duct support the diagnosis of pancreatitis. CT indicates severe disease.\n\n2. Conclusion: severe pancreatitis complicated by paralytic ileus\n   Reasoning: short-term heavy alcohol intake and binge eating, abdominal distension, tympanic percussion note, absence of ascites but significant gas retention in the gastrointestinal tract.",
  "Treatment": "1. ICU admission is required for critical care management. While closely monitoring renal function, aggressive fluid resuscitation should be performed. If respiratory status worsens, nasal high-flow oxygen therapy (NHF) or endotracheal intubation is required. Blood cultures should be obtained, and antibiotics administered based on culture results. Continuous infusion of anti-pancreatic enzyme agents should be given. A repeat abdominal CT should be performed after 48 hours to assess for abscess formation or necrotic cavities. After abdominal pain improves, early initiation of oral nutritional support is recommended."
