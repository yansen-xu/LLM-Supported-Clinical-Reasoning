  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: acute biliary pancreatitis\n   Reasoning: Persistent dull pain in the upper abdomen with belt-like radiation to the back is typical of acute pancreatitis.\nMarked elevation of serum and urine amylase levels.\nUltrasound shows gallstones, suggesting biliary obstruction as a trigger for pancreatitis.\n\n2. Conclusion: acute cholangitis (complication)\n   Reasoning: Presence of fever and jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes).\nBlood biochemistry shows markedly elevated total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), and transaminases, with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT).\nDilation of the common bile duct suggests possible common bile duct stones causing biliary obstruction and subsequent infection.\n\n3. Conclusion: acute cholecystitis\n   Reasoning: Ultrasound clearly demonstrates gallstones and cholecystitis.\nHistory of alcohol intake and frequent banquets may act as precipitating factors; although less common, the disease course of cholecystitis should be closely monitored.",
  "Treatment": "1. Nil per os (NPO) to reduce pancreatic stimulation  \nAggressive fluid resuscitation (e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride adjusted according to body weight and hemodynamic status)  \nCorrection of electrolyte imbalances and close monitoring of vital signs  \n\n2. Analgesia: for example, intravenous meloxicam or ibuprofen, adjusted according to pain severity  \nIf cholangitis is suspected, initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as a cephalosporin combined with metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone, chosen based on local pathogen profiles and resistance patterns)  \nThe typical antibiotic course is 7–10 days, adjusted according to clinical response  \n\n3. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): to be performed after adequate fluid support and stabilization, to identify common bile duct stones and, if necessary, perform stone extraction and biliary drainage to reduce the risk of biliary infection  \n\n4. Enhanced monitoring of complete blood count, liver function tests, pancreatic enzyme levels, and clinical symptoms  \nStrict observation for complications such as infection, shock, or organ dysfunction  \nProvide guidance on dietary modification and lifestyle changes, especially alcohol cessation, to prevent recurrence"
