  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute biliary pancreatitis (moderately severe)\n   Reasoning: Based on pancreatic enlargement with surrounding exudation, serum amylase >2500 IU/L, obstruction by common bile duct stones, and abnormal liver function tests\nSeverity grading: Presence of organ dysfunction (intestinal paralysis) but no persistent hypotension (normal blood gas analysis and normal coagulation function)\n\n2. Conclusion: Cholestatic liver dysfunction\n   Reasoning: Predominant elevation of direct bilirubin (DB/IB = 4:1), with markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT)\n\n3. Conclusion: Reactive pleural effusion\n   Reasoning: Acute pancreatitis complicated by small bilateral pleural effusions, with no signs of infection (normal procalcitonin)",
  "Treatment": "1. I. Pharmacological treatment\n1. Fasting with continuous gastrointestinal decompression (nasogastric tube with negative pressure suction)\n2. Fluid resuscitation: Lactated Ringer’s solution 500 ml/h intravenously to maintain urine output >0.5 ml/kg/h\n3. Acid suppression therapy: Omeprazole 40 mg IV q12h\n4. Pancreatic enzyme inhibition: Octreotide 25 mcg/h continuous infusion (72-hour course)\n5. Analgesia: Parecoxib 40 mg IV q12h\n6. Hepatoprotective therapy: Reduced glutathione 600 mg IV tid + ornithine aspartate 10 g IV bid\n\n2. II. Endoscopic treatment\n1. Emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (completed within 2 hours): bile duct stone extraction + nasobiliary drainage (post-procedure monitoring of bile drainage volume >200 ml/day)\n2. Vitamin K1 10 mg IV administered 30 minutes before ERCP (to prevent puncture-site bleeding)\n\n3. Nutritional support\n1. Initiate nasojejunal feeding 48 hours after symptom relief (short-peptide enteral formula, starting at 20 kcal/kg/day)\n2. Monitor gastric residual volume every 4 hours (pause feeding if >200 ml)"
