  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute necrotizing pancreatitis (biliary origin, severe)\n   Reasoning: CT demonstrates necrotizing pancreatitis with bilateral pleural effusion; typical severe epigastric pain radiating to the back for 4 days, accompanied by vomiting and ileus (no bowel movement for 4 days)\n   Marked inflammatory response: WBC 16.5 ×10⁹/L, neutrophils 89%; fever 38.5°C\n   Impacted common bile duct stone confirmed and removed by ERCP, indicating biliary etiology; significant elevation of bilirubin, transaminases, γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)\n   ACG 2024 guidelines classify acute pancreatitis with biliary obstruction or imaging evidence of necrosis as severe\n\n2. Conclusion: Acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis (gallstone-related cholangitis, TG18 Grade III)\n   Reasoning: Charcot’s triad (abdominal pain–fever–jaundice) plus elevated cholestatic laboratory markers\n   TG18 emphasizes urgent biliary decompression in severe cholangitis; ERCP with stone removal and drainage has been completed\n\n3. Conclusion: Hypertriglyceridemia (6.25 mmol/L) with stress-induced hyperglycemia (13.9 mmol/L)\n   Reasoning: Triglycerides > 5.6 mmol/L and glucose > 11 mmol/L, associated with pancreatitis; concurrent metabolic management required\n\n4. Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes mellitus to be ruled out\n   Reasoning: First detection of hyperglycemia during the disease course; follow-up evaluation with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and/or HbA1c needed",
  "Treatment": "1. Initial supportive care\n• Resuscitation: Lactated Ringer’s solution 5–10 mL/kg·h during the first 24 h, target urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg·h; close assessment with inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound and hematocrit (Hct)\n• Analgesia: Intravenous tramadol or oxycodone via continuous infusion; patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) if necessary\n• Fasting (NPO) ≤ 24 h, then early nasojejunal feeding, 25 kcal/kg/day\n\n2. Control of biliary infection\n• Antibiotics: Ertapenem 1 g qd or piperacillin–tazobactam 4.5 g q8h, duration 7–10 days\n• ERCP has relieved the obstruction; recheck bilirubin and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 48 h to assess response\n\n3. Monitoring pancreatic necrosis and prevention of complications\n• No routine prophylactic antibiotics\n• Repeat contrast-enhanced CT at day 7–10: if infected necrosis suspected (gas on imaging, persistent fever) → percutaneous/endoscopic drainage ± step-up antibiotics\n• Low-molecular-weight heparin 4000 IU qd for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis; bilateral pleural effusion < 30 mm → observation, > 30 mm or with respiratory distress → thoracentesis or tube drainage\n\n4. Metabolic correction\n• Continuous intravenous insulin infusion: targets triglycerides < 5.6 mmol/L and glucose 7–10 mmol/L; daily monitoring of triglycerides, glucose, and electrolytes\n• Consider single-session plasma exchange if triglycerides ≥ 11.3 mmol/L or metabolic acidosis occurs; current levels do not require this\n\n5. Surgery and follow-up\n• After stabilization (normalization of inflammatory markers, anesthesia tolerance), laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 4–6 weeks to prevent recurrent biliary pancreatitis\n\n6. ICU/ward dynamic assessment\n• Record respiratory, circulatory, and renal function every 12 h; BISAP score daily\n• CRP, procalcitonin (PCT), hematocrit (Hct), liver and renal function every other day; escalate monitoring promptly if SOFA score ≥ 2\n\n7. Discharge and follow-up\n• Recheck triglycerides, HbA1c, and abdominal ultrasound 1 month after discharge; complete cholecystectomy within 6 months\n• Dietitian-guided low-fat diet (< 15% of total calories), alcohol abstinence, target BMI 18.5–23"
