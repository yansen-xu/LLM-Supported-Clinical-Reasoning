      "content": "Triggering factors: During the Spring Festival, I attended banquets every day, drank alcohol, and played cards. I got drunk on the evening of the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\nDuration: Abdominal pain and distension have lasted for 4 days, with gradually worsening symptoms.\n\nAggravating/relieving factors: No obvious relieving factors. The abdominal pain continues to worsen and radiates to the lower back.\n\nAssociated symptoms: Fever, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, no bowel movements, and marked abdominal distension.\n\nUnhygienic food/special dietary history: Heavy alcohol consumption; diet was not particularly careful, but no clear history of unhygienic food intake.\n\nTreatment history: No treatment was given, as it was initially thought to be discomfort caused by alcohol intake.\n\nImaging studies:\n- Ultrasound: Gallstones, cholecystitis, dilated common bile duct.\n- Gastroscopy: Chronic superficial gastritis with erosions.\n- Abdominal CT: Necrotizing pancreatitis, gallstones, bilateral pleural effusion.\n\nBlood tests:\n- TBIL: 123.1 μmol/L\n- DBIL: 99.0 μmol/L\n- ALT: 609 U/L\n- AST: 308 U/L\n- ALK-P: 245 U/L\n- GGT: 1057 U/L\n- WBC: 16.49 ×10⁹/L\n- Neut%: 89.1%\n- Glucose: 13.86 mmol/L\n- Triglyceride: 6.25 mmol/L\n- Serum amylase (AMY): 2642 IU/L\n- Urine amylase (UAMY): 2315 IU/L",

  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute necrotizing pancreatitis (severe acute pancreatitis, SAP)\nPossible biliary pancreatitis\n   Reasoning: History of alcohol consumption and overeating, upper abdominal pain and distension radiating to the back. Abdominal CT shows necrotizing pancreatitis, gallstones, and bilateral pleural effusion. Blood tests: - Total bilirubin (TBIL): 123.1 μmol/L - Direct bilirubin (DBIL): 99.0 μmol/L - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 609 U/L - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 308 U/L - Alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P): 245 U/L - Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT): 1057 U/L - White blood cell count (WBC): 16.49 ×10⁹/L - Neutrophil percentage (Neut%): 89.1% - Glucose: 13.86 mmol/L - Triglycerides: 6.25 mmol/L - Serum amylase (AMY): 2642 IU/L - Urine amylase (UAMY): 2315 IU/L\n\n2. Conclusion: Gallstones with cholecystitis\n   Reasoning: Presence of gallstones, cholecystitis, and dilated common bile duct.",
  "Treatment": "1. Critical condition explained to the patient; admission to intensive care unit (ICU), fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, nutritional support therapy, acid suppression and enzyme inhibition, analgesia, and prevention of infection and shock.\n2. Etiological treatment: For biliary pancreatitis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stone extraction or stent placement to relieve obstruction; or open surgery if necessary. For cholecystitis/gallstones, cholecystectomy should be performed after the patient’s condition stabilizes.\n3. Monitoring for complications: Renal function, respiratory function, and coagulation function should be closely monitored to prevent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)."
