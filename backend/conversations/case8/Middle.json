  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Necrotizing pancreatitis\n   Reasoning: Blood tests show alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 245 U/L, γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 1057 U/L, white blood cell count (WBC) 16.49 ×10⁹/L, neutrophil percentage (Neut%) 89.1%, glucose 13.86 mmol/L, triglycerides 6.25 mmol/L. Ultrasound shows gallstones, cholecystitis, and a dilated common bile duct. Gastroscopy shows chronic superficial gastritis with erosions. Serum amylase (AMY) 2642 IU/L and urine amylase (UAMY) 2315 IU/L. Abdominal CT shows necrotizing pancreatitis, gallstones, and bilateral pleural effusion.\n\n2. Conclusion: Obstructive jaundice\n   Reasoning: Total bilirubin (TBIL) 123.1 μmol/L, direct bilirubin (DBIL) 99.0 μmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 609 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 308 U/L; ultrasound shows gallstones, cholecystitis, and a dilated common bile duct.\n\n3. Conclusion: Pleural effusion\n   Reasoning: Abdominal CT shows necrotizing pancreatitis, gallstones, and bilateral pleural effusion.\n\n4. Conclusion: Hepatic dysfunction\n   Reasoning: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 609 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 308 U/L",
  "Treatment": "1. Complete tumor marker testing and contrast-enhanced abdominal MRI to clarify whether the pancreatic lesion is benign or malignant\n\n2. Fasting and gastrointestinal decompression; fluid resuscitation and electrolyte balance; use of somatostatin (e.g., octreotide) to inhibit pancreatic secretion; anti-infective therapy, analgesia, and anti-inflammatory treatment; nutritional support; hepatoprotective therapy; percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTCD) to relieve obstructive jaundice; mechanical ventilatory support; close monitoring of laboratory results"
