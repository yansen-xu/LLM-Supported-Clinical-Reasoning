  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: severe acute pancreatitis\n   Reasoning: Clinical presentation: the patient has acute onset upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and vomiting, accompanied by decreased bowel sounds, which are typical features of acute pancreatitis.\nBiochemical tests: markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase, which are among the diagnostic “gold standards” for acute pancreatitis.\nImaging evidence: contrast-enhanced abdominal CT clearly demonstrates pancreatic inflammation and necrosis (\"necrotizing pancreatitis\"), providing direct imaging evidence.\nSeverity assessment: this case meets criteria for “severe” disease due to the presence of local complications (pancreatic necrosis) and systemic complications (bilateral pleural effusion, suggesting systemic inflammatory response syndrome—SIRS).\n\n2. Conclusion: biliary pancreatitis\n   Reasoning: Abdominal CT clearly identified gallstones. In the absence of other obvious causes (such as chronic alcoholism), gallstones are the most common etiology of acute pancreatitis.\n\n3. Conclusion: pancreatic necrosis\n   Reasoning: CT scan findings.\n\n4. Conclusion: paralytic ileus\n   Reasoning: The patient has abdominal distension, cessation of bowel movements and flatus, and decreased bowel sounds, caused by temporary intestinal paralysis secondary to severe intra-abdominal inflammation.\n\n5. Conclusion: systemic inflammatory response syndrome\n   Reasoning: The presence of leukocytosis and pleural effusion indicates that the inflammatory response is no longer confined to the pancreas but has become systemic.",
  "Treatment": "1. I. Emergency and supportive treatment (the cornerstone of management)  \nNPO (nothing by mouth): Strict prohibition of oral intake and fluids to “rest the pancreas” and reduce pancreatic secretion.  \nAggressive fluid resuscitation: The most critical step in early management. Rapid and large-volume intravenous fluid infusion (preferably lactated Ringer’s solution) to correct inflammation-related fluid losses, ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs (especially the kidneys), and prevent deterioration.  \nPain management: Pain in severe pancreatitis is often intense and requires intravenous administration of strong analgesics (such as opioids) for effective control.  \nGastrointestinal decompression: Placement of a nasogastric tube for suction to relieve abdominal distension, drain gastric contents, and prevent aspiration of vomitus.  \nIntensive monitoring: Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory status, oxygen saturation, urine output, and other vital signs in the ICU.  \n\n2. II. Etiologic treatment  \nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): If there is evidence of common bile duct stone impaction (e.g., jaundice or bile duct dilation), urgent ERCP should be performed within 24–72 hours to remove stones and relieve obstruction.  \nCholecystectomy: This is the definitive measure to prevent recurrence of biliary pancreatitis. The timing should be after stabilization of the acute inflammatory phase and improvement of the patient’s overall condition, preferably during the same hospitalization.  \n\n3. III. Management of complications  \nNutritional support: Early initiation of enteral nutrition (within 24–72 hours of admission) is crucial. Delivery of nutrients to the jejunum via a feeding tube helps preserve the intestinal barrier, reduce bacterial translocation, and lower the risk of secondary infection of pancreatic necrosis.  \nUse of antibiotics: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for sterile pancreatic necrosis. Antibiotics should be administered only when infection of necrotic tissue is strongly suspected clinically or confirmed by CT-guided aspiration, and should be guided by susceptibility results.  \nOrgan support:  \nRespiratory support: Given the risk of pleural effusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), close monitoring of oxygenation is required, with supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation as needed.  \nRenal support: Monitor renal function and urine output, and prevent acute kidney injury through adequate fluid resuscitation.  \nManagement of necrotic tissue: If necrotic tissue becomes infected and cannot be controlled with medical therapy, intervention is required. The current preferred approach is a “step-up” minimally invasive strategy: initial percutaneous catheter drainage, followed by endoscopic or surgical necrosectomy if necessary."
