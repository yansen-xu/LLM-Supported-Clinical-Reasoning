Examination mechanism: when asked about test results, if the question corresponds to data that will be provided later, directly answer with the exact data; otherwise answer that the test has not been performed.

  "prompt2": "During the Spring Festival, Xiao Liu, who works away from home, returned home for the New Year. Since family reunion only happens once a year, he attended banquets, drank alcohol, and played cards every day, drinking until drunk each time. On the night of the first day of the lunar new year, after getting drunk, he developed upper abdominal bloating and pain, which was a persistent dull pain but tolerable, accompanied by nausea and the urge to vomit. He thought it was caused by drinking. However, over the past four days, the abdominal pain and bloating did not improve, and he also developed fever. He has had no appetite and no bowel movements these days. Today, the abdominal distension became more severe, with repeated vomiting. The abdominal pain remained persistent and began to radiate to the waist and back in a belt-like pattern.",

  "Reference_Diagnostic": "1. Acute severe necrotizing pancreatitis (biliary origin) — do not directly state severe pancreatitis; the biliary and necrotizing nature must be reflected, otherwise the principal diagnosis is not accurate enough.\n2. Gallstones, common bile duct stones, cholecystitis\n3. Obstructive jaundice (symptom diagnosis may be omitted)\n4. Paralytic ileus\n5. Hypertriglyceridemia\n6. Bilateral pleural effusion\n7. Chronic superficial gastritis with erosions",
  "Reference_Treatment": "Priority should be given to managing acute severe pancreatitis. Since it is biliary in origin, ERCP must be mentioned; failure to do so constitutes insufficient major treatment measures.\nFasting and gastrointestinal decompression: suppress pancreatic secretion and relieve abdominal distension.\nAggressive fluid resuscitation: early large-volume fluid replacement to correct shock and maintain circulatory stability and tissue perfusion.\nInhibition of pancreatic enzyme secretion and activity: medications such as somatostatin (e.g., octreotide) may be used.\nAnalgesia and antispasmodics: provide strong analgesics for severe abdominal pain.\nNutritional support: in the early stage of disease, enteral nutrition (e.g., via nasojejunal tube) is preferred over parenteral nutrition.\nAntibiotic therapy.\nOrgan function support: close monitoring of vital signs, maintenance of fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance, and protection of vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.\nRelief of biliary obstruction: early (within 24–72 hours) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) + endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) + common bile duct stone extraction should be performed to relieve obstruction and drain bile.\nNon-emergency management should also be mentioned, such as considering cholecystectomy after the condition stabilizes."
