  "Diagnosis": "1. Conclusion: Acute cholecystitis\n   Reasoning: Presence of gallstones, elevated white blood cell count, abdominal pain, and fever\n\n2. Conclusion: Common bile duct stones with acute cholangitis\n   Reasoning: Dilated common bile duct, jaundice, fever, and elevated white blood cell count\n\n3. Conclusion: Secondary peritonitis\n   Reasoning: Possible; requires further confirmation with abdominal ultrasound or other imaging studies",
  "Treatment": "1. Pharmacological treatment:\nAntibiotics: Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q8h (to cover Gram-negative bacteria), combined with metronidazole 0.5 g IV q8h (for anaerobic coverage), for a treatment course of 7–10 days.\nFluid resuscitation and electrolyte correction: Normal saline/Ringer’s solution to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (adjust based on electrolyte results).\nAntipyretic and analgesic therapy: Acetaminophen 0.5 g orally q6h (as needed).\nUrsodeoxycholic acid: 250 mg orally bid.\n\n2. Non-pharmacological treatment:\nFasting plus gastrointestinal decompression: Nasogastric tube decompression to relieve vomiting and abdominal distension.\nEndoscopic treatment: Emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to relieve common bile duct obstruction, with placement of endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD).\nSurgical treatment: If ERCP fails or cholecystitis is severe, laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus common bile duct exploration is required.\n\n3. Nursing care:\nClose monitoring of temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and changes in abdominal signs.\nRecord fluid intake and output; dynamic monitoring of liver function, bilirubin, complete blood count, and electrolytes.\nMaintain airway patency and prevent hypostatic pneumonia.\n\n4. Follow-up plan:\nRepeat abdominal ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) 24–48 hours after treatment to assess the biliary system.\nRecheck liver function tests and inflammatory markers 1 week after surgery or ERCP.\nRepeat abdominal ultrasound within 3 months to rule out residual stones or recurrence."
